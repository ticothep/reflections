Git and GitHub: Lesson 3 Notes

1) What is GitHub?

  -GitHub is a website that makes it easy for you to share entire Git
  repositories with other people.
  -This allows different people from all different parts of the world to work on
  a project together.

2) Syncing Repositories from Local to GitHub

  -You computer will use a "remote," which is a place where files go before they
  are sent to the GitHub repository that you've created.
  -You can either 'push' (send files) or 'pull' (receive files) to/from the
  GitHub repository.
  -If a commit or repository already exists within the GitHub repository, GitHub
  will not bother sending it because that would be inefficient.
  -GitHub pushes and pulls files according to their branches. This allows GitHub
  to trace commits by their parents.
